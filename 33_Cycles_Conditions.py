#Python has a basic type of None.
#It is used to define the abscense of a value.

#It is usefull when we dont know what kind of value we are going to manipulate

#Create an empty value

result = None
print(result) #The variable result it is empty
print(type(result))

#Lets assign a new value
result = (1,2,3)
print(result) #The variable result it is not empty
print(type(result))

#In this way, we are not going to use memory spaces that are not going to be used.
